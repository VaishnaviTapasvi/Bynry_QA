# WorkFlow Pro – QA Automation Assignment

## Primary Tool Experience: Selenium WebDriver
I have hands on experience with Selenium WebDriver for UI automation.
For tools like Playwright, pytest, and BrowserStack, I have explained the testing approach conceptually, mapping them to equivalent Selenium concepts.


## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the QA Automation assignment.
The focus of this submission is on testing strategy, framework design, and
automation thinking rather than fully executable scripts.

## Tools & Skills
- Primary Tool: Selenium WebDriver (Python)
- API Testing: Python requests (conceptual)
- Other Tools (conceptual understanding): Playwright, pytest, BrowserStack

## Repository Structure
- test-plan/        → High-level test planning
- test-cases/       → Test scenarios and flows
- automation/       → Automation solutions for Part 1, 2, and 3
- test-data/        → Environment, tenant, and user data
- reports/          → Sample test execution report
- docs/             → Testing approach and assumptions

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install selenium requests
3. Update test-data files with environment-specific values
4. Execute automation scripts conceptually (demo purpose)

## Notes
- Playwright, pytest, and BrowserStack are explained conceptually.
- Selenium is used for implementation where applicable.
- Focus is on testing mindset and design decisions.
